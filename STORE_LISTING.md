# Chrome Web Store Listing - Permission Justifications

## For the "Why does this extension need these permissions?" section:

### activeTab
**Why needed:** To capture the specific webpage section you select. This permission allows ComponentCanvas to read the HTML content of the component you've chosen to save when you click the capture button.

### storage  
**Why needed:** To save your captured components locally on your device. All data is stored in Chrome's local storage and never leaves your computer.

### scripting
**Why needed:** To inject the visual capture interface onto webpages, allowing you to select which component you want to capture.

### tabs
**Why needed:** To refresh component content from their source websites when you click the refresh button in your dashboard. This allows ComponentCanvas to fetch updated content while minimizing background activity.

### <all_urls> (Host Permissions)
**Why needed:** To capture content from any website you choose to visit. ComponentCanvas works with all websites, giving you the flexibility to capture components from any source you find useful.
