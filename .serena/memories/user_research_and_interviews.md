# User Research & Interviews

## Interview Stats (As of Feb 2, 2026)

**Moderated Interviews Completed**: 4 successful (10 attempted total)
- **Success rate**: 40% (6 skipped due to poor persona fit)
- **Successful interviewees**: Claude, Sergio, Aniket (best fit), Michael
- **Method**: Remote interviews with friends/network who fit target persona
- **Platform**: NOT IndieAppCircle - those are unmoderated tests, not interviews

**IndieAppCircle Testing**: Separate unmoderated platform
- Users take tests as jobs (paid), not interviewed personally
- Lower quality data but scalable
- Use for: Onboarding validation, bug discovery, volume over depth
- Do NOT mix with moderated interview data

## Critical Insight: Retention Problem

**None of the 4 successful interviewees have returned to use the product** (based on GA4 activity)

**Implication**: Lacking "wow effect" or perceived value
- Users understand the concept during interview
- May see potential value
- But don't integrate into daily workflow
- **Gap**: Interview excitement ≠ Real-world retention

## Validated Personas (4/4 interviews)

1. **Visual Organizer**: Claude, Sergio, Michael (3/4 = 75%)
   - Sports, finance, deals, charts/graphs
   - Navigate by images first
   - Successful captures but refresh failures block value

2. **Optimizer**: Aniket (best fit) (1/4 = 25%)
   - Heavy tab user, deliberate sources
   - Scheduled routine

## Interview Format

- Remote (video call)
- Friend/network recruitment (not cold outreach)
- Pre-screen for persona fit before scheduling
- Focus on behavior observation + feature validation

## Key Learnings

- **Pre-screening is critical**: 60% rejection rate when not pre-screened
- **Retention ≠ Interview enthusiasm**: All 4 liked concept, 0 returned
- **Refresh reliability blocking value**: Pattern of initial capture success → refresh failure creates trust issues (Michael, Bet365/FlashScore)
- **Pause button confusion**: 3/4 users misunderstood (75% confusion rate)

## Next Research Priorities

1. **Understand retention gap**: Why don't interviewed users return?
2. **Fix refresh parity**: Before more interviews, need reliability
3. **GA4 dashboard**: Monday task to track actual usage patterns
4. **Value prop validation**: "What would it take to use daily?" question must be mandatory
